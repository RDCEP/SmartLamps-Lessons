#### Welcome to SmartLamps!!

#### Let's start coding!

##### Step 1: Let's go to a "TERMINAL". 

* TERMINAL is a screen where you can enter commands that computer can understand.
* TERMINAL is the window on the right ----->
        
* If there is no window to the right, do the following:
    - To open terminal click on "File" menu on the top left corner. 
    - In the drop-down menu, click on "New Terminal"
    - This will open a column to your right here ---->

    
##### Step 2: Let's select our programming Language

* This tells the computer the language we will be speaking in!
        
* The name of our programming language is called Python and the version is 3.6. So in short we will type the following 

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
python3.6
```
and press the return/enter key!
        
* You should get an output on the screen like this:

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
Python 3.6.5 (default, Mar 29 2018, 03:28:50)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```


##### Step 3: Let's start programming!

* The instructions we give the computer are called COMMANDS. 

* The computer INTERPRETS these commands to see if it "knows" the command

* If it knows the command it EXECUTES it 
        
* After EXECUTION, it gives a reply called an OUTPUT
        
**We have learned 4 new words!!**
COMMAND, INTERPRET, EXECUTE and OUTPUT
          
##### Step 4: Testing our first command: "print" command        

* "print" command tells the computer to output something.

* Let's get the computer to say *Hello World!*

* The correct way to enter a command is called a SYNTAX.

* SYNTAX says what special symbols to use, such as BRACKETS ( ) after print and double-quotes " " inside the brackets

* The computer outputs everything inside the double-quotes " "

* Here is the correct SYNTAX for using the "print" command


#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
> print (" Hello World! ")
```

***Try it out in the terminal ---->***

Do you get the following output?

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::

```
Hello World!
```

##### Step 5: Let's try it out!

* Now that you have learned how to make the computer type something, could you make it type the following?
        
    - Make the computer say Hello followed by your name & exclamation mark. Eg, if your name is Alice, the command will look like this:
```   
print("Hello Alice!")
```
        
    - Make the computer say *I really like programming!*
        
    - Make the computer ask your name: *What is your name?*

    - Make the computer say anything else you can think of!
