## Variable operations
We saw how to defile variables in a previous lesson. Variables are like containers that can hold any value. The value can be of any type (such as integer, floating point or string). Today we will look at some of the things we can do with variables

Let's start by opening python
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
> python3.6
```

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
Python 3.6.5 (default, Aug 29 2018, 03:28:50)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

#### There are a few rules to defining names of variables
First let's look at rules for defining variables. 

1. Variable names are case sensitive. For eg., CAT & cat are considered two different variables. They can hold two different values. 

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> CAT = 5
>>> cat = 1000
```

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>>
```

Now try printing the two values using print statement & you will see the difference

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> print (CAT)
```

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>> 5
```

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> print (cat)
```

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>> 1000
```
2. Variable names can have letters and numbers but NO special characters except underscore (_). Eg. Hello123, Dog_Cat

3. The first letter of the variable has to be a character from a-z or A-Z or special symbol underscore (_)

4. It is best to use a mnemonic as variable name to indicate what value we store there. For example, if we want to store phone number of Sam & Anna, you can pick variable names like Sam_phone and Anna_phone to know what you store in the variable.
