# SmartLamps Lesson 4

## In this lesson, we will look at mathematical operations!

You can do the following mathematical operations in python. Each has a symbol.

Addition, subtraction & division has the same symbols we use in notebooks. 

- Addition : **+**
- Subtraction: **-**
- Division: **/**

However, multiplication and exponent have slightly different symbols. (This is so as to not confuse multiplication x with letter x!)

- Multiplication: __*__
- Exponent: __**__

You can also use brackets to specify order of operation. Look at the video ***here*** for more on order of operations. 

- brackets ( )

Remember to use ( ) only 
Do not { } or [ ] as they have special meaning python. We will be looking at them later!
