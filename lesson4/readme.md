# SmartLamps Lesson 4

## In this lesson, we will look at mathematical operations!

You can do the following mathematical operations in python. Each has a symbol.

Addition, subtraction & division has the same symbols we use in notebooks. 

- Addition : **+**
- Subtraction: **-**
- Division: **/**

However, multiplication and exponent have slightly different symbols. (This is so as to not confuse multiplication x with letter x!)

- Multiplication: __*__
- Exponent: __**__

You can also use brackets to specify order of operation. Look at the video ***here*** for more on order of operations. 

- brackets ( )

Remember to use **( )** brackets only 
Do not use **{ }** or **[ ]** brackets as they have special meaning python. We will be looking at them later! 

#### Let's try out some operations
Start by opening python
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
> python3.6
```

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
Python 3.6.5 (default, Aug 29 2018, 03:28:50)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Here is how we can use operations:
#### 1. Addition
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 + 5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
12
```
Try adding more numbers, try out negative numbers, floats or really big numbers!
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 1287.9 + 8564.5 + 8764.5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
18616.9
```
***
#### 2. Subtraction
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 - 5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
2
```
***
#### 3. Multiplication
Notice the __*__ symbol for multiplication
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 * 5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
35
```
***
#### 4. Division
Notice the __/__ symbol for multiplication
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 / 5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
1.4
```
***
#### 5. Exponent
Notice the __**__ symbol for multiplication
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 ** 5
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
16807
```
***
#### 6. Brackets
Using ( ) to change order of operation
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> (7 * 5) + 4
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
39
```
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 * (5 + 4)
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
63
```
***

#### BONUS:
#### 7. Modulo
Modulo gives the reminder of division. It's symbol is **%**

For eg.,
- 4 % 3 = 1
- 5 % 3 = 2
- 6 % 3 = 0
- 7 % 3 = 1

and so on..

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> 7 % 4
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
3
```
