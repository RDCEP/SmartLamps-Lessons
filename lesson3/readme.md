## SmartLamps Lesson 3
## Let's look at VARIABLES today

We saw that variables are like boxes, which can hold different values inside them. As their values vary in time, they are called VARIABLES. 

#### To begin, let's open python
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
> python3.6
```
You should get an output on the screen like this:

#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
Python 3.6.5 (default, Aug 29 2018, 03:28:50)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
In python we use ASSIGNMENT statement to give a value to a variable.

#### Here is the syntax for the assignment statement: 

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> x = 2
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>>
```
There is no output for ASSIGNMENT statement. When you get back the >>> symbol in the next line, it means your ASSIGNMENT worked! 

In an assignment statement,
Left side: VARIABLE
Right side: VALUE

The VALUE **2** has been stored in the VARIABLE **x**. 

#### To check if this worked, try the following:

Type the variable name **x** and see what the terminal outputs
#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> x
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>> 2
```

As we see, the terminal outputs the VALUE stored in the variable **x**

#### You can use a variable with python commands:

So far, we have seen two python commands, the *print* command and the *type* command. You can use both of these commands with variables too! 

Let's try it out

***For a variable do not use quotes " ". A quote is only for string values***

#### :: _What we type_ ::
```
>>> print (x)
```
#### :: _What terminal outputs_ ::
```
>>> 2
```
Again, we get the value stored in the variable!
